## About

webgate.pro is a official website of Webgate Systems. Created with Ruby on Rails framework like a multilanguage application
for our internal purpose and, of course, to show what exactly we do and how.

Features
--------

* Edge technologies, for example RoR 4.2.1 caching style, asynchronous JS for SPDY etc.
* Automatic tests (covering more then 90%) with poltergeist or selenium (if you prefer to observe what's going on) to easy support and upgrade application/environment.

##### Prerequisites

The setups steps expect following tools installed on the system.

- Git
- Ruby [3.2.2]
- Rails [7.0.5]
- Postgresql [15]
- redis-server [5.0.7]

### Initial installation

##### 1. Create config/config.yml file

```bash
cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
```

##### 2. Create config/sidekiq.yml file

### If you want to use without Docker:

##### 1. Install Gems

```bash
bundle exec bundle install
```

##### 2. Create .ENV file

The terminal must be in the root folder of the project

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next we need to add the PG username and password

```bash
nano .env
```

For example: (User must be created locally in Postgresql)

```bash
POSTGRES_USER: 'your postgres user name'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'your postgres user password'
```

##### 3. Create DB

```ruby
bundle exec rails db:create
```

##### 4. Run migration

```ruby
bundle exce rails db:seed
```

```ruby
bundle exec rails s
```

And now you can visit the site with the URL http://localhost:3000
