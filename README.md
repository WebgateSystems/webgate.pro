## About

webgate.pro is a official website of Webgate Systems. Created with Ruby on Rails framework like a multilanguage application
for our internal purpose and, of course, to show what exactly we do and how.

Features
--------

* Edge technologies, for example RoR 4.2.1 caching style, asynchronous JS for SPDY etc.
* Automatic tests (covering more then 90%) with poltergeist or selenium (if you prefer to observe what's going on) to easy support and upgrade application/environment.
